# WebStudio

My first pet project!:paw_prints::blush: Using HTML, CSS/SASS and JS a little.

The website introduces us to WebStudio, a team that offers IT services to businesses. 
On the main page, you can find information about WebStudio's activities, features, 
team members, contacts, and regular customers. To order a service, simply click 
on the button and fill out the form in the modal window. 

Additionally, the Portfolio page showcases cards with information about the projects 
that have been developed.
